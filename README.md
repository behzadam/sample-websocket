# Simple WebSocket Client and Server in Node.js

## Getting Started

Run the following commands to start the server:

```bash
pnpm install
node server.js
```

Open `index.html` in a browser to connect to the server by VSCode Live Server extension.
Then check the Chrome network tab and `ws` tab to see the WebSocket connection.
